<protocol name="dwl_ipc_unstable_v2">

      This protocol allows clients to update and get updates from dwl.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible
      changes may be added together with the corresponding interface
      version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version
      number in the protocol and interface names and resetting the
      interface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable,
      the 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and
      interface names are removed and the interface version number is
      reset.

      This interface is exposed as a global in wl_registry.

      Clients can use this interface to get a dwl_ipc_output.
      After binding the client will recieve the dwl_ipc_manager.tags and dwl_ipc_manager.layout events.
      The dwl_ipc_manager.tags and dwl_ipc_manager.layout events expose tags and layouts to the client.
